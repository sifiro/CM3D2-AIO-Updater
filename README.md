# CM3D2-AIO-Updater
A Bash Script for create AIO Installers for Multi-Updates or Multi-DLC
For now, only can use with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or use in a GNU/Linux Distro
It's almost usable BUT, there is an issues about update.lst with remplacing double new line to a simple new line so... 
I recommend use that part with a text editor like notepad++ (for now)
